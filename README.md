# Code for Ben-Eater based 65c02 Computer Projects

## Description
I write code for my 65c02 project, all of the code files are dumped here

## Building
The projects are built using [vasm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), [vlink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), and [vbcc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). First, assembly files are assembled to .vobj files using vasm. Next, C files are compiled to assembly using vbcc, and then assembled to .vobj files using vasm. Finally, the .vobj files are linked together into a .bin rom image using vlink and a linker script.
